// v1.27.0 added the arrival reserve, and the cleanest way to think about it is

// is why the arithmetic below is not merely similar to plannableMilesForTick's
// but IDENTICAL, and why this delegates instead of repeating it: the two
// functions are one question asked from opposite ends of the trip. "How far
// can I plan on running from here?" and "how far must I still be able to run
// when I arrive?" are the same subtraction.
//
// arrivalReserveMiles(RESERVE_TICKS) === 0, which is what makes the standard
// reserve exactly the behaviour every release before v1.27.0 had.

// The arrival switch is ONE number again since v1.42.0: with it on, no plan
// may land the driver under ARRIVAL_TOGGLE_TICK — half a tank, 300 mi of
// range above the floor.
//
// The history, since this dial has moved every which way: v1.27.0 offered a
// 1/8-1/2 dial, v1.30.1 dropped 1/8, v1.35.0 collapsed it to one switch at
// 1/2, v1.37.0 raised it to 5/8, v1.38.0 split it into a 1/4 floor plus a 1/2
// "aim", v1.40.0 pushed the floor to 3/8 when the app's own floor rose — and
// v1.42.0 deleted the aim and came back to the single 1/2 the fleet asked for
// in the first place.
//
// WHY THE AIM DIED. It was a SYMMETRIC target: the planner re-picked the last
// stop to land the arrival closest to 1/2, counting an arrival above it as
// just as wrong as one below. For a control a driver reads as "leave me some
// fuel", that is backwards. Measured on a real Dallas->Carteret run: at 700
// mi range the aim moved the last stop earlier and cut the arrival from 566
// mi to 350 — the switch made things WORSE than leaving it off — and at 900,
// where one stop covers the run, it had nothing it was allowed to re-pick and
// silently did nothing at all. A minimum has neither fault: the planner adds
// a stop when it must, always takes the furthest reachable one, and so lands
// the driver as full as the route allows and never under half.
//
// RETIRED IN v1.56.0. The flat half-tank was the wrong shape: it held back 300
// miles whether the delivery had fuel across the street or 200 miles away.
// Measured over 84 real plans, sizing the reserve to the actual delivery
// instead dropped a stop from 47 of them and added one to none. What replaces
// it is reserveToReachFuel() below.

/* WHAT THE ARRIVAL RESERVE IS ACTUALLY FOR (v1.56.0).
   Not "arrive comfortably full" — that is a feeling, and it cost a stop on a
   fifth of all loads. The real question is the one a driver asks at the door:
   CAN I REACH FUEL AFTER I DROP, OR DO I NEED IT BEFORE?

   That depends on the delivery, not on the tank. Network fuel sits a median of
   26 mi from a real delivery (Boise 3, Denver 6, Nashville 14, Redlands 24,
   Atlanta 42) with a long tail — Fargo 194, Albuquerque 202. A flat 300-mi
   cushion is wildly more than the common case needs and, past ~230 mi of
   detour, still not enough for the tail. Sizing it to the delivery fixes both
   ends.

   THE ARITHMETIC. Arriving with X plannable miles means X + RESERVE_TICKS
   worth of physical diesel in the tank, because the planner never spends the
   bottom quarter. The bottom EIGHTH is never spent at all, so what is really
   available to go and find fuel after dropping the trailer is
   (X + 300) - 150. Set that at or above the road distance to the nearest stop
   and solve for X.

   STRAIGHT LINE IS NOT ROAD MILES, and this is the one place that difference
   could strand someone, so it is inflated rather than hoped about. 1.3 is the
   usual circuity factor for US highway travel; the never-spent eighth sits
   underneath it as the real margin. */

/* ---- Gallons, and what a stop is worth (v1.51.0) ----
   The app was pure miles until now, and miles are not what earns a shower
   credit: gallons are. A driver who tops off 300 mi into a tank pumps ~36
   gallons, waits in the same line, and earns nothing. So the planner needs to
   know what a leg is worth at the pump.

   MPG IS AN ASSUMPTION AND IS STATED AS ONE. 8.5 is the fleet's working
   figure and is deliberately below the 8.9 currently measured.

   WHICH WAY THAT ERRS DEPENDS ON THE QUESTION, and an earlier version of this
   comment had it backwards, so it is worth being exact. Gallons are miles
   DIVIDED by mpg, so a low mpg figure produces a HIGH gallon estimate:

     - for RANGE, 8.5 is conservative. Fewer miles per gallon means less
       range than the truck really has, and planning short is safe.
     - for GALLONS, 8.5 is optimistic. A 500-mi leg estimates 60.3 combined
       gal at 8.5 but pumps about 57.6 at a real 8.9 — so a leg sitting just
       above the credit line here can still miss it at the pump.

   One constant cannot be safe in both directions, and 8.5 is the fleet's
   number, so the gap is documented rather than papered over: treat a fill
   within a few gallons of CREDIT_GALLONS as a coin toss, not a credit. The
   labels the planner prints say "short of a credit" wherever the estimate
   itself falls under the line, which is the honest half of this.

   DEF rides at ~2.5% of diesel volume on a modern SCR engine, and the credit
   is counted on the COMBINED total, which is how the fleet's stops are
   scored — so it is combined gallons that this module reports. */

const CREDIT_GALLONS = 60;

/* WHAT THE TANKS ACTUALLY HOLD, and why it does not contradict the 1200-mi

   gallons is the real ceiling — which at 8.5 mpg would be 1530 mi of driving,
   not 1200. The 1200 is deliberately short of that: it is the COMFORTABLE
   full-to-empty the fleet plans on, and the difference is the margin nobody
   wants to spend. Both numbers are right; they answer different questions.

   The cap is here so a fill estimate can never claim more than the tanks can
   take. At the target leg it is nowhere near binding (~72 gal of 180) — it
   exists to stop a very long leg, or a future change to MPG, from printing a

/* WHAT THE PUMP ACTUALLY TAKES (v1.58.0), which is not the leg you just drove.

   Every stop is filled to full, so the pump replaces whatever the tank is
   short. Leave a stop full, drive a leg, and what is missing IS that leg — so
   for every stop after the first, fill and leg are the same number, which is
   why using the leg went unnoticed for seven releases.

   The FIRST stop is different whenever the driver did not roll out of the
   shipper full. It has to replace the leg AND whatever was already gone. On a
   real report — Midland at 5/8, 304 mi to Petro El Paso — the leg is 304 mi
   (37 gal) but the tank arrives 754 mi down and takes about 91 gal. The app
   called that "23 gal short of a credit" when it comfortably earns one, which
   is the advice backwards, not just the number.

   It cannot exceed a tank: arriving at all means pickupFuel >= leg, so
   leg + (FULL - pickupFuel) <= FULL. Clamped anyway. */

   pumps ~72 combined gallons, which clears the 60-gallon credit with ~12 to
   spare. Aiming AT the credit line instead would put every stop on the edge
   of missing it, and a fuel plan that is only just good enough is not one.

   TARGET_FILL_TICK is 4 for the same reason ARRIVAL_TOGGLE_TICK is — half a
   tank is a natural place to think about — but they are NOT the same quantity
   and must not be collapsed into one constant: this is how empty the tank
   should be when the driver pulls IN to fuel, that one is how full it should
   be when they pull in to DELIVER. */

/* WHEN A STOP IS NOT WORTH TAKING (v1.52.0). The arrival reserve is a
   minimum, and a minimum can force a stop the driver would never choose: on a
   1100-mi run at the 700-mi tier the reserve adds a second stop 20 mi from
   the receiver that pumps ~55 gal. That stop earns no credit, costs a full
   pull-in, and sits so close to the delivery that the same fuel could be
   bought AFTER dropping the trailer instead — which is the one place the
   driver is guaranteed to have time.

   So Auto is allowed to skip exactly that stop. The rule needs three things
   to be true at once, and all three matter:

     - it is reserve-forced: the truck reaches the receiver without it,
     - it earns no credit: its fill is under CREDIT_MILES,
     - it is within SKIP_NEAR_RECEIVER_MI of the receiver.

   WHY THIS CANNOT STRAND ANYONE, which is the whole reason it is safe to do:
   the range the planner spends is already net of RESERVE_TICKS. Arriving with
   zero PLANNABLE miles left means arriving at 1/4 of a tank — 300 real miles
   of diesel still in the tanks. Skipping the stop trades a nearly-full
   arrival for a quarter-tank one; it never trades it for an empty one. (On
   the backup band the same arithmetic lands at 1/8, 150 real miles, on a trip
   that by definition is shorter than that band.)

   100 mi is the threshold because it is about the last hour of a run: close
   enough that fuelling after delivery is the same day's work, far enough that
   a stop genuinely mid-route is never touched. The arrival reading and the
   nearest-stops-to-delivery panel, both already on the results screen, are
   what make the trade legible when it is taken. */
const SKIP_NEAR_RECEIVER_MI = 100;

/* THE SECOND WAY A FORCED STOP STOPS BEING WORTH TAKING (v1.53.0), and the
   one the road found first. Coppell TX -> Redlands CA, 1375 mi at the 900-mi
   tier: Auto added TA Tonopah at mile 1105 for a 490-mi leg — 59 gal, a
   gallon under the line — while TA Ontario sits 19 mi from the receiver. Two
   stops to earn one credit, where one stop plus fuelling after the drop earns
   the same one.

   SKIP_NEAR_RECEIVER_MI could never catch that: Tonopah is 270 mi out, and
   widening a window measured from the SKIPPED STOP to 270 mi would start
   skipping stops that are genuinely mid-route. The thing that makes the skip
   acceptable here is not where the forced stop sat — it is that fuel is
   waiting at the DESTINATION. So it is measured there instead, and the two
   tests are independent: either the forced stop is close enough to the
   receiver to take afterwards, or there is network fuel close enough to the
   receiver to use instead.

   50 mi is a hop once the trailer is off, not a side trip. On the run above
